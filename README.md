# Hospital Management System - Console App (.NET 8)

A fully functional Hospital Management System built using .NET 8 Console App. This project is designed for learning and demonstration purposes, showcasing practical implementation of:

Entity Framework Core (Database Handling)
CRUD operations on Patient Records
JSON-based Data Backup & Import
Human-readable Logging with Serilog
Clean code, modular functions, and professional practices

Features Implemented
Core Functionality
Add New Patient
View All Patients
Update Existing Patient
Delete Patient Record**
earch Patient by Name or Disease
Export patient's database to Json file for backup
import the database of system looses or crashes

Each feature interacts directly with a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core for safe and efficient data management.

Logging (Serilog)
All operations are logged with professional, human-readable messages, such as:
```
[2025-07-06] INFORMATION: Patient "Leo" (ID 15) updated by Admin. Data refreshed. ðŸŽ‰
[2025-07-06] ERROR: Tried to delete non-existent patient. *sad trombone*
```

Logging types:
- `Information`: For successful operations
- `Warning`: For empty results, invalid input, or skipped actions
- `Error`: For unexpected or failed operations

Logs are stored in a daily log file under a `Logs/` directory.

---

Backup & Restore (Dump Feature)
Export Patient Data to JSON** (`/backup/patients_backup.json`)
Import Data from Backup** to restore all records

This uses JSON serialization and ensures you can make a full database snapshot for later use.

---

Tech Stack
- `.NET 8` Console App
- `Entity Framework Core` (Code First Approach)
- `SQL Server`
- `Serilog` for logging
- `Newtonsoft.Json` for backup/restore
- Modular and Clean Codebase
